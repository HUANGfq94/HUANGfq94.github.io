# Biography

I am Huang Fuqing, a 29-year-old male who completed my Ph.D. at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences / Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2023. My research has been primarily focused on disease animal models and the study of gut microbiota. Throughout my career, I have contributed to the publication of 10 SCI-indexed papers in my field of study. I have had the privilege of being the first author on three top-tier papers within the first zone of the Chinese Academy of Sciences journals, notably in Bioresource Technology (2023) and the Journal of Dairy Science (2018, 2022). Additionally, I have played a role in applying for two patents and have been an active participant in significant funding projects, including the National Key Research and Development Program and the Strategic Priority Research Program (Type A) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
